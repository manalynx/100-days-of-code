### Day 1: July 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: \
1- I publicly announced that I'll start the challange using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode. \
2- I started the first course of FreeCodeCamp’s curriculum "Responsive Web Design". The course consist of number of challanges and projects. \
3- Done with the first project “Learning HTML by building a cat photo app”.It was divided into 68 challanges.


**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
