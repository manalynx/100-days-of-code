### Day 1: July 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: \
1- I publicly announced that I'll start the challange using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode. \
2- I started the first course of FreeCodeCamp’s curriculum "Responsive Web Design". The course consist of number of challanges and projects. \
3- Done with the first project “Learning HTML by building a cat photo app”.It was divided into 68 challanges.


**Thoughts**: As it was my first time learning with FCC I found it clear and fun. During that project i learned basic HTML and CSS.At the end of the day I was satasfied. \ Some of what I learned are: \
1- order and unorderd lists. \
2- Text filds. \
3- Form element. \
4- Types of input (submit , radio , checkbox). \
5- label. \
6- borders. \ and much more.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
